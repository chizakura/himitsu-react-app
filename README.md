# Project Overview

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

## Project Description

**Himitsu** is a React application that uses an anime API to get basic information on any anime title. The user can browse a list of anime by alphabetical order, genre, or by using a search bar. The user can also save a list of anime to remember the ones they are interested in watching.

<!-- - [Himitsu - React Application]() -->

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe.

- [Himitsu Homepage]()
- [Himitsu Plan to Watch Page]()

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matix.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.

#### MVP 

- Find and use external api
- Render data on page in a list
- Data looks good on page
- Add search bar to look for anime by title
- Add selected data to plan to watch page

#### PostMVP 

- Create a filter dropdown
- Select certain filters to get list of anime that matches

## React Architectural Design

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components.

| Component | Description |
| --- | :---: |
| Homepage | This will render the main page with the nav |
| SearchBar | This will render the search bar |
| PlanWatch | This will render the plan to watch page |


Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the game. Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: |
| Add Homepage | H | 2hrs | - |
| Add Search Bar | H | 2hrs | - |
| Add Plan to Watch Page | H | 2hrs | - |
| Use API to Load Anime List | H | 5hrs | - |
| Display Anime in Boxes | H | 6hrs | - |
| Use Search Bar to Get List of Anime | H | 4hrs| - |
| Add Selected Anime to Plan to Watch Page | H | 6hrs | - |
| Add Filter Dropdown Option | L | 5hrs | - |
| Use Filter to Search Anime | L | 5hrs | - |
| Total |  | 38hrs | - |
